# Project 1 – Text Mining AI (Python)

## Overview
This project is a Python-based text-mining AI tool that analyzes any writing sample I provide.  
It reads a text file, breaks the writing into sentences and words, and generates statistics that help me understand my writing patterns. The program also identifies the most common words I use and detects possible overused words. The script exports a human-readable report (`text_report.txt`) and a structured data report (`text_report.csv`).

## How This Project Meets the AI Objective
This project fulfills the AI requirement **“Create, analyze, and integrate artificial intelligence applications and IoT systems”** by demonstrating my ability to build and analyze an AI-style data-processing tool.  
Even though this runs on Python and not a microcontroller, it clearly shows the *create* and *analyze* parts:

- I created an AI-style natural-language analysis tool using Python.  
- It uses tokenization, pattern recognition, data extraction, and frequency analysis — all core concepts in AI and machine learning.  
- The program produces structured output through CSV export, showing that the data can be integrated into larger systems, dashboards, or IoT workflows later.

This project demonstrates my ability to design real AI logic, analyze real data, and generate meaningful insights.

## Features
- Sentence breakdown  
- Word frequency analysis  
- Overused-word detection  
- Sentence-length statistics  
- Automatically generated text report  
- Automatically generated CSV file  
- Clean output usable for IoT dashboards or future machine-learning models  

## Files Included
- `text_mining_ai.py`
- `text_report.txt`
- `text_report.csv`
- Any input text files I analyzed

## How to Run
```bash
python text_mining_ai.py my_text_file.txt

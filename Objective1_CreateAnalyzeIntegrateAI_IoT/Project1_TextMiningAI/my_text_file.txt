The goal of this project is to create a humanoid robot that functions as both an assistant and a companion, capable of offering help, information, and even a physical helping hand when needed. This robot is envisioned as a platform for mutual learning — a system that can both educate its user and expand its own knowledge through guided interaction. Over time, it will develop increasing levels of autonomy, balanced with built-in safeguards to ensure safe and ethical behavior. A long-term ambition is to explore how an AI-driven robot can be taught basic ethics and moral reasoning, allowing it to distinguish right from wrong within defined boundaries. For now, the first milestone is foundational: to design and build a 3D-printed bipedal droid capable of standing upright and walking at a natural, human-like pace — a mechanical body ready for the intelligence that will follow.
Vision Statement
To build a humanoid companion that learns, assists, and grows alongside its user — a robot capable of both practical help and ethical understanding, beginning with the simple yet profound goal of standing and walking like a human.

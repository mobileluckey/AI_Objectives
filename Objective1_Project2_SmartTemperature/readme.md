Objective 1 – Project 2: Smart Temperature AI System

UAT AI Objective: Create, analyze, and integrate artificial intelligence applications and IoT systems.

📘 Project Summary

This project simulates a smart temperature-monitoring AI system. It uses Python to read temperature samples,
apply an AI-style classification model, and output system alerts.

The model evaluates temperature trends and determines environmental conditions: SAFE, WARM, or DANGEROUS.

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates for Objective 1

This project proves that I can:

Build an AI-driven environment classifier

Process real-time numeric sensor inputs

Apply rule-based inference (AI logic)

Create system alerts based on temperature patterns

Log and analyze environmental data

This fulfills both the create and analyze portions of the objective.

🔥 Classification Logic
temp < 75      →  SAFE
75–89°F        →  WARM
≥ 90°F         →  DANGEROUS


This is an appropriate AI rule-based model for embedded or IoT systems.

🧪 Example Output
Current Temp: 92°F  
Status: DANGEROUS  
Action: Cooling system needed

Stores data for later training or analysis

🎯 How This Project Meets Objective 1

This project shows that I can integrate AI logic with sensor-style numeric input, which is 
a key skill in IoT and embedded AI. The classification engine demonstrates my ability to create
and analyze AI-driven systems while simulating a real-world IoT workflow. This directly supports Objective 1.

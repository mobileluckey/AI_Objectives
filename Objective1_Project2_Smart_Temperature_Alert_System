Smart Temperature Alert System (AI + IoT Project)

This project demonstrates how to integrate IoT sensor data, cloud messaging, and simple AI-style analysis.
I created a virtual smart temperature monitoring system using Tinkercad Circuits, Python, and HiveMQ Cloud.
The system publishes real-time temperature readings to the cloud and uses a subscriber program to analyze the
data and classify the temperature conditions.

Project Overview

This project simulates an IoT temperature monitoring device and an AI-driven alert system:

Tinkercad Circuit
Arduino Uno + TMP36 sensor + LEDs
LEDs show local status: Normal / Warm / Hot.

MQTT Cloud Pipeline
A Python script publishes simulated temperature readings to a secure MQTT broker hosted on HiveMQ Cloud.

AI Subscriber
A second Python script subscribes to the MQTT topic, stores a rolling history of readings, calculates a moving average, and classifies the environment into:

NORMAL

WARM

ALERT (Too Hot)

This demonstrates sensor integration, cloud communication, data processing, and real-time decision-making.

# Objective 2 – Project 3: WordNet Explorer

**Objective 2:** Create and evolve natural language processing systems.

## Project Overview

This project is a **WordNet Explorer** written in Python. The program allows me to type in a word and explore it using **WordNet**, a lexical database commonly used in NLP systems.

The tool outputs:

- Word definitions (multiple senses)
- Example sentences (when available)
- Synonyms
- Antonyms

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the area of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, analyze, and generate human language.
This is a practical NLP “language knowledge” tool that can support vocabulary learning, lesson building, and language analysis.

## How It Meets Objective 2

This project meets **Objective 2: Create and evolve natural language processing systems** because it:

- Accepts **natural language input** from the user (typed words).
- Uses an NLP lexical resource (WordNet) to **process meaning and relationships** between words.
- Produces structured language output (definitions, synonyms, antonyms) that could support a learning tool like my TutiTech language tutor.
- Can be **evolved over time** by adding features like:
  - phrase support,
  - word similarity,
  - related word forms,
  - flashcard mode,
  - or multilingual expansions using other WordNet resources.

## How to Run It

1. Install Python 3.

2. Install the required dependency:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
